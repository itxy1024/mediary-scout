# Reliable, SELF-VERIFYING self-host redeploy: pull the latest repository state and
# published web image, restart the stack, then prove they point to the same commit.
#
# Why this exists (2026-07-04 #88–#98): five deploys in a row silently kept serving OLD
# code — the box ran a stale image for a whole day before anyone noticed. The failure
# was invisible because the usual signals lie: host `git rev-parse HEAD` shows the new
# commit even when the container runs an old image, and watching the image hash is noisy
# (a fresh `--no-cache` build changes the hash purely from build non-determinism). So the
# real fix isn't a cache trick — it's a check: this script compares the RUNNING
# container's stamped commit (BUILD_COMMIT) against HEAD and exits non-zero on mismatch,
# which catches a stale build, a no-op `git pull`, or a container that wasn't recreated.
#
# Usage (on the host, in the repo dir):   ./scripts/deploy.sh [extra `up` args]
set -eu

# Repo root = the script's parent dir. Plain dirname (no `--`, no `cd --`) for
# portability across /bin/sh implementations (busybox ash, dash, bash).
